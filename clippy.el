;;; Commentary:

;; This library implements rendering of pop-up box with "Clippy, the
;; paper clip".  You can make him say various things by calling
;; `clippy-say' function.  To hide the pop-up, simply invoke any
;; command (move forward/backward, type, `C-g` etc., any event is
;; recognized).

;; As inspiration, two functions are provided:
;; `clippy-describe-function' and `clippy-describe-variable'.  Bind
;; any of these functions to a key, then while point is over a
;; function/variable, call it.  A popup with helpfull clippy will
;; appear, telling you about the function/variable (using
;; `describe-function' and `describe-variable' respectively).

;;; Code:
